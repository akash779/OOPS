Object Oriented Programming
List of Programs
1) Define a class to represent a bank account. Include the following members:
Data members: 1. Name of the depositor. 2. Account number. 3. Type of account. 4.
Balance amount in the account.
Member functions: 1. To assign initial values. 2. To deposit an amount. 3. To withdraw an
amount after checking the balance. 4. To display the name and balance.
Write a main program to test the program.
2) Create two classes DM and DB which store the value of distances. DM stores distances in
meters and centimeters and DB in feet and inches. Write a program that can read values
for the class objects and add one object of DM with another object of DB. Use a friend
function to carry out the addition operation. The object that stores the results may be a
DM object or DB object, depending on the units in which the results are required. The
display should be in the format of feet and inches or meters and centimeters depending on
the object on display.
3) A book shop maintains the inventory of books that are being sold at the shop. The list
includes details such as author, title, price, publisher and stock position. Whenever a
customer wants a book, the sales person inputs the title and author and the system
searches the list and displays whether it is available or not. If it is not, an appropriate
message is displayed. If it is, then the system displays the book details and requests for
the number of copies required. If the requested copies are available, the total cost of the
requested copies is displayed; otherwise “Required copies not in stock” is displayed.
Design a system using a class called books with suitable member functions and
constructors.
4) Crate a class FLOAT that contains one float data member. Overload all the four
arithmetic operators so that they operate on the objects of FLOAT.
5) Assume that a bank maintains two kinds of accounts for customers, one called as savings
and the other as current account. The savings account provides compound interest and
withdrawal facilities but no cheque book facility. The current account provides cheque
book facility but no interest. Current account holders should also maintain a minimum
balance and if the balance falls below this level a service charge is imposed. Create a
class account that stores customer name, account number and type of account. From this
derive the classes cur_acct and sav_acct to make them more specific to their
requirements. Include necessary member functions in order to achieve the following
tasks:
(a) Accept the deposit from a customer and update the balance.
(b) Display the balance.
(c) Compute and deposit interest.
(d) Permit withdrawal and update the balance.
(e) Check for the minimum balance, impose penalty, necessary and update the balance.\
6) An educational institution wishes to maintain a database of its employees. The database is
divided into a number of classes whose hierarchical relationships are shown in following
figure. The figure also shows the minimum information required for each class. Specify
all classes and define functions to create the database and retrieve individual information
as and when required.
7) Consider a class network of the following figure. The class master derives information
from both account and admin classes which in turn derives information from the class
person. Define all the four classes and write a program to create, update and display the
information contained in master objects.
8) Create a base class called shape. Use this class to store two double type values that
could be used to compute the area of figures. Derive two specific classes called triangle and
rectangle from the base shape. Add to the base class, a member function get_data() to
initialize base class data members and another member function display_area() to compute
and display the area of figures. Make display_area() as a virtual function and redefine this
function in the derived classes to suit their requirements.
9) Write a program to read a list containing item name, item code, and cost interactively
and produce a three column output as shown below.
Name Code Cost

C primer 905 95.70
10) Write a program that reads a text file and creates another file that is identical except
that every sequence of consecutive blank spaces is replaced by a single space.
11) Write a function template for finding the minimum value contained in an array.
12) Write a class template to represent a generic vector. Include member functions to
perform the following tasks:
(a) To create the vector
(b) To modify the value of a given element
(c) To multiply by a scalar value
(d) To display the vector in the following form (10, 20, 30 …)

2) Create two classes DM and DB which store the value of distances. DM stores distances in
meters and centimeters and DB in feet and inches. Write a program that can read values
for the class objects and add one object of DM with another object of DB. Use a friend
function to carry out the addition operation. The object that stores the results may be a
DM object or DB object, depending on the units in which the results are required. The
display should be in the format of feet and inches or meters and centimeters depending on
the object on display.
